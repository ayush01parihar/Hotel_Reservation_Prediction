# 🏨 Hotel Reservation Prediction

**Hotel Reservation Prediction** is a machine learning classification project aimed at predicting whether a customer will cancel their hotel booking. It combines machine learning with a robust MLOps pipeline to streamline development, deployment, and monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help hotel businesses anticipate booking cancellations using a predictive model, enabling smarter operational decisions and improved customer retention strategies.

---

## 💼 Target Audience

Hotels and hospitality providers who want to:

- Minimize revenue loss from cancellations  
- Improve occupancy forecasting  
- Personalize customer engagement  
- Identify and block potential fraudsters  

---

## 📌 Use Cases

### 1. Revenue Management  
Predict cancellations in advance to allow safe overbooking and avoid losses from unoccupied rooms.

### 2. Targeted Marketing  
Identify customers likely to cancel and offer customized incentives (e.g., discounts, amenities) to reduce churn.

### 3. Fraud Detection  
Detect patterns of repeated last-minute cancellations and flag or block such customers from future bookings.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. Cloud Storage Setup – Upload and manage data in GCP Buckets  
2. Data Ingestion – Pull and split data for training and testing  
3. Jupyter Prototyping – Initial testing and model selection  
4. Production Code – Refactor code into modular Python scripts and classes  
5. Experiment Tracking – Use MLflow for model tracking and comparison  
6. Training Pipeline – Combine ingestion, processing, and training steps into one executable flow  
7. Versioning –  
   - GitHub for code and small data  
   - DVC for large-scale data versioning  
8. UI App – Flask-based frontend for prediction inputs  
9. CI/CD Pipeline – Jenkins + Docker + GCP for automated deployment  

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Deployment

- **Trigger**: Code push to GitHub  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Jenkins pulls latest code  
  2. Builds Docker image  
  3. Pushes to Google Container Registry (GCR)  
  4. Deploys to Google Cloud Run  

Result: A live, scalable web app for hotel staff and management.
