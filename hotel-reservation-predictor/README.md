🏨 Hotel Reservation Prediction
Hotel Reservation Prediction is a machine learning classification project aimed at predicting whether a customer will cancel their hotel booking. It combines machine learning with a robust MLOps pipeline to streamline development, deployment, and monitoring.

🎯 Objective
To help hotel businesses anticipate booking cancellations using a predictive model, enabling smarter operational decisions and improved customer retention strategies.

💼 Target Audience
Hotels and hospitality providers who want to:

Minimize revenue loss from cancellations

Improve occupancy forecasting

Personalize customer engagement

Identify and block potential fraudsters

📌 Use Cases
Revenue Management
Predict cancellations in advance to allow safe overbooking and avoid losses from unoccupied rooms.

Targeted Marketing
Identify customers likely to cancel and offer customized incentives (e.g., discounts, amenities) to reduce churn.

Fraud Detection
Detect patterns of repeated last-minute cancellations and flag or block such customers from future bookings.
